## üìÑ Overview

**AI Career Navigator** is an intelligent Python command-line tool designed to provide users with personalized career guidance and development strategies. By analyzing a user's CV (Curriculum Vitae) and/or a structured profile, the application leverages modules for skills analysis, market trend identification, career path generation, and career progression simulation. It aims to suggest suitable future roles, identify critical skills to acquire or enhance, and offer insights into potential career trajectories, including simulated salary and promotion timelines. The output recommendations are delivered in a structured JSON format for easy parsing and further use.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   üìù **Comprehensive Skills Analysis (`skills_analyzer.py`)**:
    *   Extracts skills from user-provided CVs (text files) or structured profiles (JSON).
    *   Evaluates existing skills against a `skills_database.csv`.
*   üìà **Market Trend Analysis (`market_trends.py`)**:
    *   Processes job market data (from `job_market_data.csv`) to identify in-demand skills, emerging roles, and industry trends relevant to the user's profile.
*   üõ§Ô∏è **Personalized Career Path Generation (`career_path.py`)**:
    *   Suggests potential career paths based on the user's current role, extracted skills, and market demands.
    *   Leverages `roles_database.csv` for information on different career roles and their requirements.
*   ‚è≥ **Career Progression Simulation (`career_simulator.py`)**:
    *   Simulates potential career progression over time for suggested paths.
    *   May include estimations for salary growth, promotion timelines, and skill development milestones.
*   üíª **Flexible Command-Line Interface (CLI)**:
    *   Accepts user CV (as a text file path) and/or profile (as a JSON file path) via command-line arguments.
    *   Allows users to specify a `target-role` for more focused recommendations.
    *   Outputs detailed recommendations and simulation results to a specified JSON file (default: `career_recommendations.json`).
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Modular Design**: Core functionalities are separated into distinct Python modules (`skills_analyzer.py`, `market_trends.py`, etc.) for better organization and maintainability.
*   üìÑ **Configuration Management (`config/config.py`)**: Centralizes configuration settings, such as paths to data models or API keys (if external APIs were to be integrated).
*   ‚úçÔ∏è **Logging**: Records application events, progress, and errors to `ai_career_navigator.log` and also outputs to the console for immediate feedback.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements & Dependencies

### Software:
*   **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher.
*   **Libraries**:
    *   `pandas`: For data handling and analysis, especially with CSV files.
    *   *(Potentially others like `nltk`, `spacy` for advanced CV parsing, `scikit-learn` for skill matching, `requests` for fetching market data - these would need to be added to `pip install` if used by the modules).*

### Data Files:
*   Located in the `data/` directory:
    *   `skills_database.csv`: A CSV file mapping skills to various attributes (e.g., categories, proficiency levels).
    *   `roles_database.csv`: A CSV file detailing different career roles, their required skills, typical progression paths, etc.
    *   `job_market_data.csv`: A CSV file containing data on job market trends, skill demand, salary ranges, etc.

## üíæ Data Requirements

The quality and format of the CSV files in the `data/` directory are crucial for the application's performance:

*   **`skills_database.csv`**: Should contain a comprehensive list of skills, possibly categorized or weighted.
    *   Example columns: `skill_id`, `skill_name`, `category`, `description`.
*   **`roles_database.csv`**: Should define various job roles and their associated skill requirements.
    *   Example columns: `role_id`, `role_name`, `required_skill_ids`, `typical_experience_years`, `next_level_role_ids`.
*   **`job_market_data.csv`**: Should include up-to-date information about job market trends.
    *   Example columns: `skill_name`, `demand_level` (e.g., High/Medium/Low), `average_salary_range`, `emerging_trend` (boolean).

*The exact schema and content of these CSVs will heavily influence the logic within the Python modules.*

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` with your specific details).*

2.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Required Libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    # pip install -r requirements.txt # If a requirements.txt file is provided
    ```

4.  **Prepare Data Files**:
    *   Ensure the `data/` directory exists in the project root.
    *   Place the required CSV files (`skills_database.csv`, `roles_database.csv`, `job_market_data.csv`) into the `data/` directory. Ensure they are correctly formatted as expected by the Python modules.

5.  **Configure (if necessary)**:
    *   Check `config/config.py` for any paths or settings that might need adjustment for your environment (though typically it should be set up for relative paths).

## üí° Usage Guide (Command-Line Interface)

Run the `main.py` script from the project's root directory using Python, providing command-line arguments to specify inputs and outputs.

**Basic Command Structure:**
```bash
python main.py [--cv PATH_TO_CV.TXT] [--profile PATH_TO_PROFILE.JSON] [--target-role "TARGET_ROLE_NAME"] [--output OUTPUT_FILENAME.JSON]
```
**Arguments:**

*   `--cv PATH_TO_CV.TXT`: (Optional) Path to a plain text file containing the user's CV.
*   `--profile PATH_TO_PROFILE.JSON`: (Optional) Path to a JSON file containing structured user profile data (e.g., current role, skills, experience).
    *At least one of `--cv` or `--profile` should typically be provided for analysis.*
*   `--target-role "TARGET_ROLE_NAME"`: (Optional) The specific career role the user is aiming for. This helps tailor recommendations.
*   `--output OUTPUT_FILENAME.JSON`: (Optional) The name of the JSON file where recommendations will be saved. Defaults to `career_recommendations.json`.

**Example Usages:**

1.  **Analyze a CV and aim for a specific role:**
    ```bash
    python main.py --cv ./my_documents/cv.txt --target-role "Data Scientist Lead" --output my_ds_career_path.json
    ```
2.  **Analyze a JSON profile without a specific target role:**
    ```bash
    python main.py --profile ./user_profiles/john_doe.json
    ```
    *(This will output to `career_recommendations.json` by default).*

The application will process the inputs, perform the analyses, and generate a JSON file containing:
*   Suggested career paths.
*   Skill development recommendations.
*   Relevant market insights.
*   Data from the career progression simulation.
Console output will indicate progress and the location of the output file.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project File Structure
*   `main.py`: The main Python script that parses command-line arguments, instantiates the `AICareerNavigator` class (or orchestrates modules), and drives the analysis pipeline.
*   `modules/` (directory): Contains the core Python modules for different analytical tasks:
    *   `skills_analyzer.py`: Implements the `SkillsAnalyzer` class/functions.
    *   `market_trends.py`: Implements the `MarketTrends` class/functions.
    *   `career_path.py`: Implements the `CareerPathGenerator` class/functions.
    *   `career_simulator.py`: Implements the `CareerSimulator` class/functions.
*   `config/` (directory):
    *   `config.py`: Python file for application configuration (e.g., file paths, API keys if any, model parameters).
*   `data/` (directory): Contains the necessary CSV data files:
    *   `skills_database.csv`
    *   `roles_database.csv`
    *   `job_market_data.csv`
*   `ai_career_navigator.log`: Log file where application events, progress, and errors are recorded.
*   `README.md`: This documentation file.
*   (Potentially `requirements.txt` for pip dependencies).

## üìù Technical Notes & Considerations
*   **Data Quality**: The accuracy and usefulness of the recommendations heavily depend on the quality, comprehensiveness, and currency of the data in `skills_database.csv`, `roles_database.csv`, and `job_market_data.csv`.
*   **Module Implementation**: The functionality relies on the robust implementation of the classes/functions within each Python module in the `modules/` directory (e.g., `SkillsAnalyzer`, `MarketTrends`). The overview assumes these exist and perform their intended data processing.
*   **Logging**: The application uses Python's `logging` module (or a custom logger) to output informational messages and errors to both the console and `ai_career_navigator.log`.
*   **Placeholder Logic**: The note "app uses placeholder logic for some operations (e.g., role ID lookup)" indicates that some internal mechanisms might be simplified and would require more sophisticated implementations for real-world accuracy (e.g., fuzzy matching for roles, complex skill weighting).
*   **"AI-Driven"**: The term "AI-driven" implies some level of intelligent processing. This could range from rule-based systems and statistical analysis (based on the CSV data) to more advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) for CV parsing or machine learning models for prediction/recommendation, depending on the depth of implementation in the modules. The current description points more towards data-driven analysis from CSVs.
*   **Scalability**: For handling a large number of users or very large datasets, optimizations in data loading (e.g., using Pandas efficiently, database integration) and processing might be necessary.
